      "description": "When he came to, he found himself in a white room that he didn't recognize...\n\nTakatou Keisuke was locked in a white, closed room with six other women: his childhood friend Hokari Kanae, class rep. Andou Miyako, junior Makiba Rika, English teacher Aoi Natsuki, same-year student Byakuya Rinne, and classmate Manaka Nemu. All of them were confused by this abnormal situation when a \"mysterious voice\" suddenly announced to them:\n\n\"The game will now begin.\"\n\nKeisuke must become an \"Unlocker\" and select one of the women as a \"Keyhole,\" then perform a specified act with her to \"open the lock\" so that they can all escape from the white rooms.\n\nOne girl went into a frenzy over those acts' irrational, extreme, and immoral contents, lashing out at the \"mysterious voice.\" The lights suddenly went out, and all the girls shrieked out of fear. When the lights came back on, the first thing Keisuke and the others saw was the rebellious girl from earlier, restrained to a torture device.\n\n\"Withdrawal from the game will result in death.\" - the mysterious voice announced.\n\nThe electric current began to run through the torture device the moment after the voice stopped speaking. The girl's eyes rolled up into the back of her head as she went incontinent, defecating and urinating herself. The women cried and shouted, clearly disturbed by what was happening before them.\n\nOn the other hand, Keisuke found himself inexplicably aroused by what was happening to the said girl. For he kept a dark secret. A taste for sexual assault and destructive urges against women... it was his horrible desire that he wanted to keep to himself.\n\nUnfortunately for Keisuke, his classmate Nemu saw right through him this time. And being the cunning woman she is, she won't skip this opportunity to start using this newfound information so that she can blackmail him and ultimately make him submit to her.\n\n\"This is a kiss to seal our deal.\" - she said when she suddenly sealed his lips.\n\nDespite being surprised by her unexpected actions, Keisuke resolved to violate the other women as a means of escape from the white rooms to protect his childhood friend Kanae. Will Keisuke be able to escape unharmed and return to his everyday life? Or will his very desires consume him...? It remains to be seen.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/detail.php?product_code=141]MangaGamer[/url]]",

They met the three sisters Haru, Kotose and Yukina, who run the cafe “Famille”, and he starts working there in exchange for a bed to sleep in.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Shou follows Haru far away from the town to a hill covered with flowers as far as the eye could see. He watched as a little girl whom Haru was embracing turned into a flower under the large moonlit tree. She noticed his presence and smiled lonesomely while looking fondly at the beautiful flowers in full bloom.\n\n“I have survived up till now in this world by doing this. But I still want to continue living… even if it’s in exchange for other people’s lives.”\n\nShou looked up at the petals which fluttered down and responded:\n\n“No matter what this world forces upon you, no matter how many people won’t forgive you... I’ll still pray for this world to end.”\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/november-2016-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Takuma had many fond memories of the town where he used to live as a child and he wished to return there one day. He worked hard to pass the entrance exam for the only school in the town and successfully achieved his long-cherished dream!\n\nHe moved back to the town for a new start, planning on living by himself in his childhood home, but it was in such a dilapidated state that it was essentially uninhabitable. Without the money to look for a temporary residence, Takuma was at a loss as to what to do.\n\nFortunately, his childhood friends came to his rescue! While he couldn’t live with them forever, he was welcomed to stay in the four families’ homes on a rotation system. One of them strongly objected to it, but she was persuaded in the end. Thus begins a very peculiar ‘revolving temporary residency life’.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2018/03/15/march-2018-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri[/url]]",

      "description": "This is the debut title by Azarashi Soft, which falls under the Nexton brand.\n\nIt’s only the end of November and the hot springs town Yomase-machi was already a winter wonderland, having been dyed white from the falling snow. Yuuki moved to this snowy town to help his grandparents shovel snow at their home, the former boarding house Yamanouchi-sou. He met many warm-hearted people, including the shrine maiden Sayuki who worries about her inability to properly greet strangers, his mysterious but playful housemate and senpai Mizuki, and the local cafe’s cheerful and energetic kouhai mascot Koharu. Even though he was still feeling lost, he tried to get used to living in this snowy land. During that time, his grandfather suggested that he find love while he is still young and lead a new life in earnest. Now’s the time for him to take the first step and fall in love.\n\n[From [url=https://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2014/12/18/december-2014-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

Each Master summons a formidable warrior from various eras as their Servant, all vying for the ultimate prize: the Holy Grail, a wish-granting artifact.\n\nEmiya Shirou, an ordinary high school student driven by an unwavering sense of justice, finds himself unwillingly pulled into this deadly conflict. One evening, Shirou witnesses a fierce battle between Servants. The clang of steel and the crackle of magic fill the air as they clash. Mortally wounded in the chaos, Shirou is saved by the enigmatic Tohsaka Rin and her Servant Archer. In a desperate attempt to protect himself, Shirou accidentally summons his own Servant, Saber—a noble and beautiful knight with a mysterious past.\n\nAs Shirou and Saber navigate the dangerous Holy Grail War, they form alliances and face numerous adversaries, each with their own ambitions and secrets. The bond between Master and Servant deepens as they confront perilous challenges and uncover hidden truths.",
